# Porfolio

This is my porfolio, a Next.js application showcasing my skills as a front-end developer. In this porfolio you will find a brief overview of my experience, my skills, and some projects I have worked on. The porfolio is fully responsive and has a dark mode. It also has a contact me page where you can send me an email.

I built this porfolio to show my skills and to have a place to showcase my work. I am constantly learning and improving my skills, so I will be updating this porfolio with new projects and information.

I hope you like it!
